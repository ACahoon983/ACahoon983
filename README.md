- Hey, I’m Andrew Cahoon.
- I'm here to do what work I can to better advertise myself.
- At the moment, the languages I'm fluent in are Java, HTML, Javascript, and Python.
- I'm best at object oriented design, abstraction, recursion, algorithm design, data structures, and full stack development.
- 
- In my free time I enjoy playing strategy games, where I try to optimize my play as best as I can. I do this in any game really,
- be it 4x, grand strategy, RPG, team-oriented FPS, etc. I've also written a couple guides on how to optimize play as a specific
- nation in the game Europa Universalis 4.
-
- I never really used github much during my time at Brandeis, so you'll have to forgive me for not having much on here.
- My email is acahoon983@gmail.com in case you need to contact me.
